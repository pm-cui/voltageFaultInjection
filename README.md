# Voltage Fault Injection
- Develop a fault injector hardware prototype using a low-cost development board (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- Execute fault injection using the developed fault injector against different products
- Study why some products are more susceptible to fault injections by extracting the MCU ROM code to identify possible failure points.

## Raspberry Pi Pico (using micropython and asm_PIO)
### Progress
- Main Program
  - test
